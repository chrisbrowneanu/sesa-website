# SESA Working Groups

Working Groups are a collection of members who have a common interest in advancing Systems Engineering in a specific domain. Whilst [INCOSE has many Working Groups](http://www.incose.org/ChaptersGroups/WorkingGroups), some of these groups operate at both the international and local INCOSE chapter level, and some are unique to INCOSE chapters such as the Australian chapter.

Select from the list of Working Groups under the SESA Working Groups menu.

Are you interested in being part of or even starting a Working Group? Please contact SESA with a brief description of the working group that you would like to start.
