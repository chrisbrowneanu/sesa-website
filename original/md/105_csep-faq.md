------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Certification Process Timing

Q.

How long do I have to complete my certification process?

A.

You have one year from the time your application is received initially
by SESA to complete your certification. The one-year period includes the
time used by the applicant to submit additional information not
contained in the initial submittal, by references to submit their
inputs, by the CASE review committee (usually less than one month), and
by the applicant to schedule and take (and retake if necessary) the
exam. If the process is not completed within the one-year time period,
the applicant will have to restart the process from the beginning,
including paying another application fee.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

How long does the review process take?

A.

Our review and processing typically takes four to six weeks. The review
starts once all of an applicantâ€™s materials, including references and
proof of degree, are received.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

For how long is a certification valid?

A.

A Systems Engineering Professional Certification is valid for a period
of three years for CSEP and five years for ASEP. The date of the renewal
period starts on the same month and day of the week as the original
certification.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

For how long is a renewal valid?

A.

Renewed certifications are valid for the same number of years as their
original certifications. So, a renewed CSEP certification is valid for
three years and a renewed ASEP application is valid for 5 years. The
date of the renewal period starts on the same month and day of the week
as the original certification.

Â 

Applications

Q.

How do I obtain an application for certification?

A.

The preferred method is to download the application form from our
website, here: [http://www.sesa.org.au/csep-forms](/csep-forms). If you
cannot download the form, please call or email our office using the
contact info on this website.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

What happens if I submit the application without the required fee?

A.

Your application will not be processed without the correct fee. You will
be notified if the funds submitted are insufficient.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

Once I submit my application, how long will it be before I receive
notice of the Certification Office\'s decision?

A.

It is not possible to give one answer that fits all situations on how
long it will take after you submit an application for you to be notified
if your certification is approved. The following is guidance from the
INCOSE website which CASE will endeavour to replicate.\
All applications are reviewed by the staff and the Certification Office
on an on-going basis. You will be notified within two weeks by the staff
of receipt of your application and will be advised if any material is
missing. After the staff determines that an application is complete, the
Certification Office will complete its assessment of the applicant\'s
education and experience typically within five weeks and, if the
experience is satisfactory, will notify the applicant to schedule the
certification exam. If the experience is not satisfactory, the
Certification Office will advise the applicant of the certification
status and may advise of possible corrective actions to continue the
certification process. The exam results will be available to the
applicant almost immediately after he/she completes the exam. The
Certification Office will provide the successful applicant with a formal
certification recognition package (certificate and card) within three
weeks of the applicant taking the certification test. INCOSE does not
control the time that an applicant takes to provide any information
missing in the application or to schedule and take the certification
exam.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

If I apply for CSEP and am not approved, do I have to re-apply to get
certified at a lower level?

A.

If you are denied at the CSEP level, you will be given the opportunity
to apply at the lower level without having to pay a new application fee.
There will be a limited time for that opportunity, which will be listed
for you in your denial message. If you are already certified at the
lower level, your application fee at the higher level may be used to pay
for your next renewal at that lower level.

Â 

Business Practices

Q.

Do I have to be a member of SESA to get CSEP?

A.

Yes, you do need to be SESA member to apply for certification as an ASEP
or CSEP and you need to maintain your membership for the duration of
your certification. You also need to be a member of Engineers Australia.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

Does INCOSE certification as a Systems Engineering Professional
authorise me to practice systems engineering in my
city/state/province/country?

A.

INCOSE Certification as a Systems Engineering Professional does not
authorise an individual to practice systems engineering. Certification
is a confirmation that an individual has demonstrated the requisite
knowledge, education, and experience associated with the certification.
Only legally empowered government organisations, through licenses,
authorise individuals to practice a skill or profession.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

Can I obtain an INCOSE Systems Engineering Professional Certification
for my business?

A.

INCOSE Systems Engineering Professional Certification recognizes the
systems engineering capabilities of an individual only. It is not
granted to a business.

\

Â 

Continuing Education & Renewals

Q.

Why do I need to track Professional Development Units?

A.

The requirement for continuing professional development is intended to
reinforce the need for lifelong learning in order to stay current with
changing technology, equipment, procedures, processes, and established
standards.Â You will need to present a record (log) of your time spent
in such activities, with Professional Development Units assigned as
describedÂ [here](http://www.incose.org/certification/CertProcess/CertRenew).

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

What courses and activities qualify for PDU credit?

A.

The Certification Office does not pre-approve particular courses or
activities. A course or activity does not have to be presented by an
â€œapprovedâ€? sponsor/provider for you to claim credit for the course
or activity. It is your responsibility to determine if the course or
activity meets your continuing education needs and to maintain
documentation adequate to support your decision to claim credit for the
particular course or activity.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

What do I submit with my renewal application to prove that I have
attained the required Professional development Units (PDUs)?

A.

When you submit your renewal application with your log of continuing
education, you sign a statement that you have completed the
courses/activities on the log and that they satisfy the continuing
education requirements. You do not have to submit any additional formal
proof with the application. However, you may be randomly selected by the
Certification Program Office, as part of its quality check, to submit
detailed descriptions and/or completion certificates of your continuing
education courses and activities.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

May I carry over excess PDU credits into the next renewal cycle?

A.

You may carry over up to 30 PDUs to the next renewal period.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

What kind of record should I keep of my continuing education?

A.

You should maintain a summary log to list your Professional Development
Unit (PDU) courses and activities. The log should contain a sufficient
name and/or description that identifies that the course or activity
relates to systems engineering. Include the name of the presenter, the
name of the sponsoring organization, and the location of where the
instruction, class, or activity was held. For classes that are part of a
college curriculum, list the class number. All records of attendance and
completion of PDU credits should be maintained for four years for audit
purposes. Records for any \"carried forward\" PDUs should be retained
for four years beyond the subsequent certification renewal

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

What can I do if I fail to renew in time?

A.

Late renewal options are available for certifications that have expired
within the previous twelve months.Â  Details are
postedÂ [here](http://www.incose.org/certification/CertProcess/CertRenew).

\

Â 

Knowledge Exam

Q.

What are the qualifications to be approved to take the Certification
examination?

A.

The qualifications for being approved to take the certification
examination are that the applicant has submitted a complete application
and application fee. After screening your application, the Certification
Office will advise you on how to schedule the exam. The intent is to
save you the exam fee if your application is administratively
incomplete. This screening is not a review of the content of your
application, just a check that it is ready to be sent to technical
review.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

How may I find out when the next examination is scheduled?

A.

When the certification staff notifies you that you are approved to take
the certification examination, the staff will send you information on
how to contact Prometric (the Test Organization) to determine when you
may schedule the examination.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

Where are the examinations given?

A.

The certification examinations are given at the Prometric (the Test
Organization) facilities. Prometric currently has over 6000 sites in
approximately 100 countries around the world. When the certification
staff notifies you that you are approved to take the certification
examination, it will send you information on how to contact Prometric to
determine the best location for you to schedule and take the
examination. Prometric authorizes additional testing centers to offer
exams as their business justification arises. To see if a testing center
near you has already been authorized to administer the CSEP INCOSE
certification exam, visit: <http://www.prometric.com/INCOSE.>

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

May I take the examination on-line?

A.

The certification examination is not available on-line. It must be taken
at a Prometric\'s (the Test Organization) facility. This examination is
proctored to control the length of time allotted to take the
examination, to confirm the identity of the individual taking the
examination, and to eliminate the use of outside help.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

What reference documents were used to create the examination questions?

A.

The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook is the reference document that
was used to create the questions in the certification examination.
Review details on which version of the handbook is in
useÂ [here](https://www.incose.org/newsevents/news/2015/05/21/incose-knowledge-exam-transition-to-sehv4).

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

How can I get a copy of the reference documents used for the examination
questions?

A.

Copies of the current version of the Systems Engineering Handbook may be
obtained from INCOSE. A soft copy may be downloaded free by INCOSE
members at www.incose.org . Printed copies may be pre-ordered directly
atÂ [Wiley](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118999401.html).

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

How are examinations prepared?

A.

The Certification Advisory Group prepares new questions which are
â€œbeta testedâ€? as part of ongoing examinations. Prometric (the Test
Organization) evaluates the quality of the new questions based on the
answers in the â€œbeta tests.â€? Successful new questions are used to
supplement or replace existing questions in the examination.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

What kind of study guides or practice exams are available for the
examination?

A.

INCOSEâ€™s Certification Program has not created any â€œstudy guidesâ€?
for the knowledge examination. We recommend study of the current version
of the INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook which is the reference
document for the certification examination.Â  Study guides and training
may be produced by external parties without oversight, review, or
endorsement from the Certification Program.Â  It is expected that a
small set of practice questions from previous versions of the SE
Handbook will be released by the Certification Program in early Summer
2015.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

When may I expect to receive my exam score?

A.

Prometric (the Test Organization) can tell you if you have passed the
examination within minutes after you complete the examination since it
is computer scored. The INCOSE Certification Program Office will follow
up with notice of your certification if you passed the examination, or
directions on continuing the process if you did not pass, within three
weeks of taking the examination.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

What is the minimum passing score for the certification exam?

A.

The passing score for the exam is based on the results of a series of
tests that have been performed on the exam itself and is based on the
results of over 60 individuals from varying levels of systems
engineering experience. The passing score reflects the minimum level of
knowledge expected from a satisfactorily practicing systems engineer
with at least five years of industrial experience after receiving a
four-year bachelorâ€™s degree in a technical field from an accredited
institution of higher education. The approach used to establish a
passing score is similar to the approach used by State Governments that
issue Professional Engineering licenses, and likewise a specific passing
score is not published. When you take the certification exam, you will
be advised immediately after you complete the computer based exam that
you have passed or failed the exam. You will not be given a numerical
score. For your guidance, you need to exhibit a level of knowledge
similar to what is expected to pass and obtain credit when taking an
academic course at a college or university.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

Why do I need to pay a separate fee to take an examination?

A.

You pay a separate fee to take the certification examination in order to
keep the total cost of the certification process down by not having
INCOSE serve as an agent in forwarding funds to the Test Organization.
Paying the test fee directly to the Test Organization is also a more
efficient process if you have to retake the examination.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

Do I need to pay an additional fee to retake the examination?

A.

Yes, you do have to pay a separate test fee to the Test Organization
each time you schedule the certification examination.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

How long is the examination?

A.

A two-hour time period is allowed for answering the questions on the
certification examination, which nominally contains 120 questions.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

What kind of questions are on the examination?

A.

The certification examination questions are currently multiple-choice
questions. All correct answers must be selected from the possible
answers given to receive credit for answering a question. A typical
question may have five possible answers listed of which three are
correct. Partial credit is not given for a question.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

Am I permitted to bring material to use during an examination?

A.

The certification examinations are closed book. The applicant is not
allowed to bring any types of reference materials, writing tablets,
notes, etc. All devices that might compromise the security of the
examination process are forbidden. Computers, cell phones, pagers, and
other electronic equipment are not permitted in the test room. The test
organization will provide any material/equipment needed to take the
examination.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

In what languages are the test offered?

A.

The test is only offered in the English language.

::: {align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Q.

Can I reschedule the exam with the test center?

A.

Yes. The Test Organization will, however, charge a fee if you reschedule
fewer than 30 days prior to your scheduled test date. If you reschedule
fewer than 5 days prior to the test date, you will be charged the full
exam fee.
