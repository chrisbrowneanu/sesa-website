| SESA is a Technical Society of [Engineers                             |
| Australia](http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/) and the Australian  |
| affiliated chapter of the [International Council on Systems           |
| Engineering](http://incose.org/) (INCOSE). Individual memberships are |
| available in three grades (Member, Student Member and Senior Member)  |
| and are purchased through Engineers Australia. Individual membership  |
| of SESA confers all of the benefits of membership of INCOSE.          |
|                                                                       |
| SESA\'s mission is to foster the definition, understanding, practice  |
| and advancement of Systems Engineering in Australian Industry,        |
| Academia and Government. SESA aims to provide the national vehicle to |
| make Systems Projects successful through the establishment of a       |
| viable Systems Engineering culture in Australia.                      |
|                                                                       |
| Individual membership is open to everyone with an interest in Systems |
| Engineering. Systems Engineering is a multi-disciplinary field and    |
| benefits from the diverse background of its members. SESA membership  |
| comprises of people working in technology domains including IT &      |
| Telecommunications, Defence, Aerospace, Intelliigent Transport,       |
| Medical Devices, and Energy Utlities. Members also come from a wide   |
| range of disciplines such as Project Management, Software & Hardware  |
| Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Integrated    |
| Logistics Support, Test Engineering and others. SESA also has strong  |
| ties with academic institutions that offer courses in Systems         |
| Engineering and research & development into Systems Engineering best  |
| practices.                                                            |
