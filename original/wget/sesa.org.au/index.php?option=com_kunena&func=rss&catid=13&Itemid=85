			<title>Subject: Identifying the Validity of data generated by isolated speed measurment Radar/Lidar ...</title>

			<description>Currently In a situation defending a &amp;quot;red light speed&amp;quot; Ticket in NSW. I have been fortunate to act as an expert witness for the court in other &amp;quot;radar&amp;quot; related cases, so I am not a novice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The issue that I have raised today with the court in my preliminary report goes to the heart of recognizing and then validating a system, as opposed to a default bureaucratic and thus legal viewpoint that a single system element is indeed a system, and once calibrated it is accurate forever. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I merely wish to put a small brake on the burgeoning nature of these systems, not overturn the road &amp;quot;safety&amp;quot; ideology. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Peer review please of my assertion &amp;quot;that an isolated system element can not be authoritative outside of its own domain.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
--------------Extract from my preliminary report----------&lt;br /&gt;
Estimation of vehicle speed from an unknown system&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5.	No evidence has been provided which would allow capture of a system level description of operation. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
6.	Similarly, no analysis of the system behavior at the interfaces of the involved elements can proceed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Validation determines that a system does all the things it should and does not do what it should not do.” &lt;br /&gt;
-	INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook 4.8.2.1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
7.	For each system element the verification process provides a description of the simulation model used to establish calibration and system element integration with external calibration controls.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
8.	A further verification process describes the integration of the system measuring elements and the algorithms used to identify, measure, recognize and compensate for failure of a measurement system element, or the total system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
9.	In my opinion, It would be reckless to allow a single isolated system element to be authoritative on a measurement outside of its own domain. Similarly, a measuring system would be unreliable if its limitations were not identified and acknowledged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
