<p>It is not possible   to give one answer that fits all situations on how long it will take after   you submit an application for you to be notified if your certification is   approved. The following is guidance   from the INCOSE website which CASE will endeavour to replicate.<br> All applications are reviewed by the staff and the Certification Office on an   on-going basis. You will be notified within two weeks by the staff of receipt   of your application and will be advised if any material is missing. After the   staff determines that an application is complete, the Certification Office   will complete its assessment of the applicant's education and experience   typically within five weeks and, if the experience is satisfactory, will   notify the applicant to schedule the certification exam. If the experience is   not satisfactory, the Certification Office will advise the applicant of the   certification status and may advise of possible corrective actions to   continue the certification process. The exam results will be available to the   applicant almost immediately after he/she completes the exam. The   Certification Office will provide the successful applicant with a formal   certification recognition package (certificate and card) within three weeks   of the applicant taking the certification test. INCOSE does not control the   time that an applicant takes to provide any information missing in the   application or to schedule and take the certification exam.</p>

<p>INCOSEâ€™s Certification Program has not created any â€œstudy guidesâ€ for   the knowledge examination. We recommend study of the current version of the   INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook which is the reference document for the   certification examination.Â&nbsp; Study guides and training may be produced by   external parties without oversight, review, or endorsement from the   Certification Program.Â&nbsp; It is expected that a small set of practice   questions from previous versions of the SE Handbook will be released by the   Certification Program in early Summer 2015.</p>

<p>Prometric (the Test Organization) can tell you if you have passed the   examination within minutes after you complete the examination since it is   computer scored. The INCOSE Certification Program Office will follow up with   notice of your certification if you passed the examination, or directions on   continuing the process if you did not pass, within three weeks of taking the   examination.</p>

<td valign="top">
<p>The passing score for the exam is based on the results of a series of   tests that have been performed on the exam itself and is based on the results   of over 60 individuals from varying levels of systems engineering experience.   The passing score reflects the minimum level of knowledge expected from a   satisfactorily practicing systems engineer with at least five years of   industrial experience after receiving a four-year bachelorâ€™s degree in a   technical field from an accredited institution of higher education. The   approach used to establish a passing score is similar to the approach used by   State Governments that issue Professional Engineering licenses, and likewise   a specific passing score is not published. When you take the certification   exam, you will be advised immediately after you complete the computer based   exam that you have passed or failed the exam. You will not be given a   numerical score. For your guidance, you need to exhibit a level of knowledge   similar to what is expected to pass and obtain credit when taking an academic   course at a college or university.</p>

<p>You pay a separate fee to take the certification examination in order   to keep the total cost of the certification process down by not having INCOSE   serve as an agent in forwarding funds to the Test Organization. Paying the   test fee directly to the Test Organization is also a more efficient process   if you have to retake the examination.</p>
